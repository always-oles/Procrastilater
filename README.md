# Procrastilater
### A Chrome/Opera browser extension that helps you to schedule and organize your postponed "visit/read/watch later" bookmarks and deal with them.

## Slogan  
Stop procrastinating and overcome yourself.  
Get over your postponed tasks/knowledge/fun in bookmarks!  
  
## Idea
I am a procrastinator. I postpone some of my tasks/goals to the future.  
And I got **lots** of tabs and bookmarks in my browser.  
One day I decided to decrease the number of tabs and check what I've been collecting in my bookmarks for few years.  
I found lots and **lots** of useful articles, good music, great movies and they were all **POSTPONED**.  
So I created an extension, which can help you to discover things you forgot to visit/read/watch/listen.  
Meet the **Procrastilater**!  
He will remind you about forgotten bookmarks by popping them out in random time and track your progress to make you feel like you are achieving something.
